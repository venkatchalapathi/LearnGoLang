#### Brief History

Developed by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson at Google.
Launched at 2009 as an OSPL

#### Advantages

1.Flexible : Its is concise, simple and easy to read.

2.Concurrency : It allows multiple process running simultaneously and effectively

3.Quick Outcome : Its comilation time is very fast.

4.Library : It provides a rich standard library.

5.Garbage collection : It is a key fearute of go.
                       Control over memory allocation.
                       Dynamically reduced latency in GC.
                       

#### Disadavantages

1.No Support for generics

2.The packages distributed with this programming language is quite useful but Go is not so object-oriented in the conventional sense.

3.There is absence of some libraries especially a UI tool kit.

#### Applications

- Docker: a set of tools for deploying linux containers
- Openshift: a cloud computing platform as a service by Red Hat.
- Kubernetes: The future of seamlessly automated deployment processes
- Dropbox: migrated some of their critical components from Python to Go.
- Netflix: for two part of their server architecture.
- InfluxDB: is an open-source time series database developed by InfluxData.
- Golang: The language itself was written in Go.

#### Go vs C++

| Go            |    C++        |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Procedural and Concurrent programming language.| Object-oriented programming language. | 
|Does not contain classes with constructors and deconstructors.|Does contain classes with constructors and deconstructors.|
|Provides automatic garbage collection for allocating memory.| Does not provide automatic garbage collection for allocating memory.|
|Does not use header files. Instead of header file, go use packages|Contain header file and does not contain package|
|Use panic and recover for resolving error.|Use try, catch, and throw for resolving error.|
|Does not support inheritance. But it provides an alternative in the form of Embedding.|Supports inheritance|

#### Go vs Java

| Go            |    Java       |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|Procedural and concurrent programming language.| Object-Oriented programming language. | 
|Does not support classes with constructors and deconstructors|Supports classes with constructors and deconstructors. | 
|Does not contain the concept of exception handling instead of exception handling Go has errors.|Contains the concept of exception handling. |
|Does not support inheritance.|Supports inheritance. | 
|Does not support generics.|Supports generics. | 
|Threads in Go are cheap.|Threads in Java are expensive in comparison to Go.|
